High-level API (Python)

Async usage (asyncio):

```py
from ultraws import WebSocketClient

async def main():
    ws = await WebSocketClient.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:9000")
    await ws.send(b"hello")             # non-blocking, awaits send completion
    msg = await ws.recv()                # memoryview/bytes â€” prefer memoryview when zero-copy
    await ws.close()
```

Sync usage:

```py
from ultraws import WebSocketClient
ws = WebSocketClient.connect_sync("ws://...")
ws.send_sync(b"...")
ws.close_sync()
```

FFI considerations:

Expose connect, send, recv, close, poll_events at C ABI level.

Provide a callback registration API for event-driven users.
