Benchmarking guide and scripts

Benchmarks to include:

Throughput (messages/sec) with large payloads (16KB, 64KB) and small payloads (125B)

Latency p50/p90/p99 for request/response patterns

Concurrency scaling: 1..N connections per core

Comparison harness: libwebsockets, websocat, and a simple socket echo server

Example harness tools:

wrk, wrk2, websocat, C harness using tokio/mio

Metrics to store: throughput, latency (p50/p90/p99), CPU usage, syscalls/sec, bytes/sec

Performance gating: CI should fail if regressions >5% vs baseline stored in repo/bench/baseline.jsonBenchmarking guide and scripts
