Security considerations

Do not implement TLS in core. Document safe TLS termination patterns.

Validate handshake headers strictly; reject invalid Sec-WebSocket-Key or upgrade headers.

Rate-limit control frames (ping/pong) to avoid CPU exhaustion.

Handle oversized frames gracefully (configurable limits).

Avoid exposing raw FDs to Python without clear ownership and lifetime docs.
