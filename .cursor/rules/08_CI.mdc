CI pipeline (suggested)

Steps:

Checkout + toolchain

Build release artifact

Run unit tests

Run static analyzers (clang-tidy for C)

Run small benchmark suite (short duration) and compare vs stored baseline

Build Python wheel and run Python integration tests

Performance gating: fail PR if performance regressions >5% on measured benchmarks.

Notes: use self-hosted runners with consistent hardware for reliable benchmarking.
